        <p class="lead">While playing games on Hypixel's popular Minecraft server with my friends, I wanted an easy way to check my in-game stats and compare my progress against others. So, I decided to create a Discord Chat Bot using Python. It allows the user to conveniently access game stats through the Hypixel API.</p>

        <p class="lead">Following the command prefix, users enter their username. The program then queries the Mojang API using the requests library, to obtain a UUID, a unique Minecraft Player identifier. With this identifier, the program proceeds to query the Hypixel API for player stats. It navigates the JSON response to extract relevant statistics and presents them in a clear embed message within Discord chat, along with buttons to select different modes and gather different information.</p>

        <p class="lead">I realised the repetition of inputting your username everytime, so I designed an SQL database that connects Discord User IDs with Minecraft Player IDs. Now, leaving the username field empty still shows your player stats, and you can still enter another username to view their statistics. Improving speed and efficiency for the user.

        <button class="btn btn-secondary" type="button">Python</button>
        <button class="btn btn-secondary" type="button">Tkinter</button>

        <p class="lead">At the beginning of the year, I started to develop a Car Rental Booking System using Python, and the Tkinter library to create a GUI. The program features an simple interface, complete with dropdown menus, text boxes, and buttons for easy data input. To enhance the user experience further, I integrated a calendar library, allowing users to easily select the booking start and end dates using an calendar widget.</p>

        <p class="lead">The process begins with the user inputting their booking requirements like seat count, vehicle type and their personal information. The program then refines the vehicle list to match these requirements. Once done, the available and fitting vehicles can be easily booked by the user.</p>

        <p class="lead">To implement the booking system I used arrays to keep track of vehicles and bookings. One array stored vehicle details, while another linked booking dates and registration plates for easy identification. This setup allowed the ability to easily determine whether a vehicle is available or not and therefore ensures efficient management and smooth functionality.</p>

        <p class="lead">I noticed a potential issue that might arise, potentially the user could accidentally select an booking `end_date` earlier than or on the same day as the booking `start_date`. To address this, I've developed a function that prevents the selection of a date preceding the `start_date`, and instead, it automatically sets the `end_date` to be one day after the booking `start date`.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-5">PC Build for a Family Member</h3>

      <p class="lead">During my summer break, I undertook the task of building a new computer for a family member that was frustrated with the speed of their old PC. Their budget was approximately £500, and my objective was to construct a reliable and future-proof system capable of handling a variety of tasks.</p>

      <p class="lead">In terms of components, I went with the AM4 Platform, specifically the Ryzen A520 Chipset, and the Ryzen 5 5600G processor. This APU features 6 high-speed cores, simultaneous multi-threading, and excellent integrated graphics, making it a great fit for most tasks, including light gaming and potential 1080p video editing. For storage, I opted for the Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2TB NVME drive because of its easy installation and significantly faster speeds compared to standard SATA SSDs. This choice not only ensures faster performance but also future-proofs the computer. To complete the build, I housed everything in the Corsair 4000D case, known for its cool design and excellent airflow.</p>

          <p>Running benchmarks to ensure the PC is performing well and no thermal throttling is occuring.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="lead">Overall, I'm pleased with the PC build. The assembly process was quick and straightforward, largely because I didn't need to install a dedicated graphics card or any drives that aren't directly connected to the motherboard. In total, it took less than 30 minutes to complete and is a huge upgrade from their previous computer.</p>
